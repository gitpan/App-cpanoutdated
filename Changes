      (reported by aer0++, fixed by chiba++)

      It's distribution issue. But I added workaround.

      (reported by rafl++)
    - switch to version.pm instead of copied CPAN::Version.
      Yes, it's not 5.8 core module.
      But, if you want to use this command, you can install version.pm :P
